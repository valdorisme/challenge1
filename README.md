Accessibility Horiseon
In this challenge, I need to improve the "Horiseon" website by improving its accessibility.
I also need to refactor the code for the website; without making changes to the what is displayed on the user(s)'s screen.
With doing that, my repository needs to have multiple commit messages, has a README file, and in overall good quality.
After completion of the above, I need to ensure the URL launches properly.
